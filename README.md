# JavaScript Calculator

A simple, responsive calculator app built with React, styled with CSS, and deployed on GitHub Pages. This project fulfills the requirements of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Calculator challenge.

## Project Overview

This calculator app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) along with decimal calculations. It respects the order of operations and handles various edge cases, such as multiple operators in succession and leading zeros.

### Live Demo

Check out the live version of the app [here](https://SyntaxStrategist.github.io/js-calculator).

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with accurate results.
- **Decimal Support**: Conduct calculations with decimal numbers.
- **Clear Function**: Reset the calculator to its initial state.
